## üöÄ **How to Test**

### **1. Database Setup**
```bash
# Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy contents of database/migrations/003_personal_games_table.sql
# Execute in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
```

### **2. Frontend Testing**
```bash
# Development server should already be running
npm run dev

# http://localhost:3000/dashboard/player/personal-stats (standalone)
```

### **3. Test Scenarios**
1. **Sign in as a player**
2. **Record a game** with various stats
3. **Verify calculations** (shooting percentages, stat line)
4. **Test validation** (try invalid shooting ratios)
5. **Check game history** (expandable cards, performance badges)
6. **Test mobile experience** (responsive design, touch targets)

## üîí **Security Audit Completed (Oct 21, 2025)**

### **Comprehensive Security Hardening**
After feature implementation, a full security audit was conducted following enterprise security standards. All vulnerabilities were addressed and the feature achieved an **A (Excellent)** security rating.

### **Security Enhancements Implemented**

**1. XSS Protection**
- ‚úÖ DOMPurify sanitization on all text inputs (location, opponent, notes)
- ‚úÖ Sanitization on both input submission and display rendering
- ‚úÖ Follows established patterns from authentication system
- ‚úÖ Defense-in-depth approach with multiple protection layers

**2. Authorization & Access Control**
- ‚úÖ Removed player_id from client payloads
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enforce auth.uid() for player ownership
- ‚úÖ Zero-trust model: Database is source of truth for authorization
- ‚úÖ Tested: Player A cannot access Player B's games

**3. Input Validation**
- ‚úÖ Length limits: location (200), opponent (100), notes (500) characters
- ‚úÖ Stat bounds: Upper limits prevent manipulation (points ‚â§ 200, fouls ‚â§ 6)
- ‚úÖ 3-point validation: 3PT must be subset of FG
- ‚úÖ Shooting ratios: Made ‚â§ attempted for all categories
- ‚úÖ Date validation: Cannot record future games
- ‚úÖ Character count displays for user feedback

**4. Stat Manipulation Prevention**
- ‚úÖ Upper and lower bounds checking on all stats
- ‚úÖ Suspicious stat warnings (e.g., points > 50)
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ 15+ validation rules covering all categories

**5. Production Security**
- ‚úÖ Conditional logging (development only)
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in production logs
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages (no system exposure)
- ‚úÖ Build verification: Zero warnings, zero errors

### **Manual Security Testing Results**
- ‚úÖ XSS attempts blocked (sanitized successfully)
- ‚úÖ Negative stat values prevented
- ‚úÖ Invalid shooting ratios blocked
- ‚úÖ Player ID spoofing prevented by RLS
- ‚úÖ Future dates rejected
- ‚úÖ Excessive text lengths limited

### **Files Modified for Security**
- `src/utils/personalStatsCalculations.ts` - Added sanitizePersonalGameText()
- `src/lib/services/personalGamesService.ts` - Enhanced validation, removed player_id, conditional logging
- `src/hooks/usePersonalGames.ts` - Conditional logging
- `src/components/player-dashboard/PersonalGameForm.tsx` - Stat bounds, maxLength, character counters
