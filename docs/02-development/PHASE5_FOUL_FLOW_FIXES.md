# Phase 5: Foul Flow Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Branch**: `feature/phase4-play-sequences`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## üêõ Issues Identified

### **Issue 1: Personal/Offensive Fouls Triggering FT Modal**
**Symptom**: When recording a personal or offensive foul, the FT modal appeared when it shouldn't.

**Root Cause**: The `PlayEngine` was automatically detecting ALL fouls and triggering FT sequences based on the modifier. Since personal and offensive fouls were being recorded with modifiers, the engine was trying to determine FT counts and triggering the modal.

**Impact**: High - Breaks the foul flow UX

---

### **Issue 2: Fouls Not Linked to Free Throws**
**Symptom**: Database queries showed fouls with `ft_id: null` and `shooter_id: null`, meaning FTs weren't linked to their corresponding fouls.

**Root Cause**: The foul was being recorded without a `sequence_id`, and the FT modal was being triggered with `sequenceId: null`. This meant the foul and FTs had no common identifier to link them.

**Impact**: High - Breaks data integrity and analytics

---

### **Issue 3: Flagrant Foul Database Constraint Violation**
**Symptom**: HTTP 400 error with message: `"new row for relation \"game_stats\" violates check constraint \"game_stats_modifier_check\""`

**Root Cause**: The database CHECK constraint on the `game_stats.modifier` column didn't include `'flagrant'` or `'1-and-1'` as valid modifiers for fouls.

**Impact**: Critical - Prevents recording flagrant and bonus fouls

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: Disable PlayEngine FT Auto-Triggering**

**File**: `src/lib/engines/playEngine.ts`

**Change**: Commented out the automatic FT sequence detection for fouls.

**Reason**: The foul flow now handles FT triggering manually in `handleVictimSelection`. The PlayEngine's automatic detection was causing duplicate/premature FT modals.

**Code**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ PHASE 5: FREE THROW SEQUENCE DETECTION
// NOTE: FT sequences are now triggered manually in the foul flow (handleVictimSelection)
// This automatic detection is DISABLED to prevent duplicate FT modals
// 
// The foul flow is:
// 1. User selects foul type
// 2. User selects victim (for shooting fouls)
// 3. handleVictimSelection manually triggers FT modal via tracker.setPlayPrompt()
//
// We keep this code commented for reference but it should NOT run:
/*
if (event.statType === 'foul' && flags.freeThrowSequence) {
  // ... commented code ...
}
*/
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Personal and offensive fouls no longer trigger FT modal

---

### **Fix 2: Add sequence_id to Foul and FT Linking**

**File**: `src/app/stat-tracker-v3/page.tsx`

**Change**: Generate a `sequence_id` in `handleVictimSelection` and use it for both the foul recording and the FT modal.

**Code**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Generate sequence_id to link foul and FTs
const { v4: uuidv4 } = await import('uuid');
const sequenceId = uuidv4();

// Record the foul with sequence_id for linking
await tracker.recordStat({
  gameId: gameData.id,
  teamId: foulerTeamId,
  playerId: foulerActualPlayerId,
  customPlayerId: foulerCustomPlayerId,
  isOpponentStat: foulerIsOpponentStat,
  statType: 'foul',
  modifier: modifier,
  sequenceId: sequenceId // ‚úÖ Link foul to FTs
});

// Trigger FT modal with same sequence_id
tracker.setPlayPrompt({
  isOpen: true,
  type: 'free_throw',
  sequenceId: sequenceId, // ‚úÖ Use same sequence_id
  // ... rest of metadata
});
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Fouls and FTs now linked via `sequence_id`

---

### **Fix 3: Update Database Constraint**

**File**: `docs/02-development/PHASE5_FIX_FOUL_ISSUES.sql`

**Change**: Created SQL script to update the `game_stats_modifier_check` constraint to include all foul modifiers.

**New Constraint**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.game_stats
ADD CONSTRAINT game_stats_modifier_check CHECK (
  (
    -- Field goals: made, missed
    (stat_type IN ('field_goal', 'three_pointer') AND modifier IN ('made', 'missed'))
    OR
    -- Free throws: made, missed
    (stat_type = 'free_throw' AND modifier IN ('made', 'missed'))
    OR
    -- Rebounds: offensive, defensive
    (stat_type = 'rebound' AND modifier IN ('offensive', 'defensive'))
    OR
    -- Fouls: personal, shooting, 1-and-1, technical, flagrant, offensive
    (stat_type = 'foul' AND modifier IN ('personal', 'shooting', '1-and-1', 'technical', 'flagrant', 'offensive'))
    OR
    -- Other stats: no modifier required
    (stat_type IN ('assist', 'steal', 'block', 'turnover') AND modifier IS NULL)
    OR
    -- Turnovers with modifiers (optional)
    (stat_type = 'turnover' AND modifier IN ('offensive_foul', 'steal', 'bad_pass', 'travel', 'double_dribble'))
  )
);
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Database now accepts all foul modifiers

## üß™ Testing Verification

### **Test Case 1: Personal Foul**
- [x] Select player
- [x] Click FOUL
- [x] Select "Personal Foul"
- [x] **Expected**: Foul recorded immediately, NO FT modal
- [x] **Actual**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### **Test Case 2: Offensive Foul**
- [x] Select player
- [x] Click FOUL
- [x] Select "Offensive Foul"
- [x] **Expected**: Foul + turnover recorded, NO FT modal
- [x] **Actual**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### **Test Case 3: Shooting Foul (2PT)**
- [x] Select player
- [x] Click FOUL
- [x] Select "Shooting Foul (2PT)"
- [x] Select victim
- [x] **Expected**: Foul recorded with `sequence_id`, FT modal appears with 2 shots
- [x] Record FTs
- [x] **Expected**: FTs recorded with same `sequence_id`
- [x] **Verify in DB**: Foul and FTs have matching `sequence_id`

### **Test Case 4: Technical Foul**
- [x] Select player
- [x] Click FOUL

### **Test Case 5: Flagrant Foul**
- [x] Select player

## üìä Database Verification Query

Run this query to verify fouls are properly linked to FTs:

```sql
SELECT 
  f.id as foul_id,
  f.player_id as fouler_id,
  u1.full_name as fouler_name,
  f.modifier as foul_type,
  f.sequence_id,
  ft.id as ft_id,
  ft.player_id as shooter_id,
  u2.full_name as shooter_name,
  ft.modifier as ft_result
FROM game_stats f
LEFT JOIN game_stats ft ON f.sequence_id = ft.sequence_id AND ft.stat_type = 'free_throw'
LEFT JOIN users u1 ON f.player_id = u1.id
LEFT JOIN users u2 ON ft.player_id = u2.id
WHERE f.stat_type = 'foul'
  AND f.game_id = 'YOUR_GAME_ID'
ORDER BY f.created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result**:
- Personal fouls: `sequence_id` NULL, `ft_id` NULL ‚úÖ
- Offensive fouls: `sequence_id` NULL, `ft_id` NULL ‚úÖ
- Shooting fouls: `sequence_id` populated, `ft_id` populated, `shooter_name` populated ‚úÖ
- Technical fouls: `sequence_id` populated, `ft_id` populated ‚úÖ
- Flagrant fouls: `sequence_id` populated, `ft_id` populated ‚úÖ
