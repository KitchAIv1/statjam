# Clock Automation Testing Guide - Steal, Turnover, Foul Fixes

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**  
**Related**: `CLOCK_AUTOMATION_BUGS.md`

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Steal - Clock Continues Running ✅
**Before**: Clock paused when steal was recorded  
**After**: Clock **continues running** (NBA rule - live ball event)

### Fix 2: Turnover - Live vs Dead Ball ✅
**Before**: All turnovers paused clock  
**After**: 
- **Live ball turnovers** (steal, bad pass, lost ball): Clock **continues**
- **Dead ball turnovers** (traveling, violation): Clock **pauses**

### Fix 3: Foul - Immediate Pause ✅
**Before**: Clock paused after foul sequence (after FT modal)  
**After**: Clock pauses **immediately** when foul button is clicked (before modals)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Open StatJam in browser
2. Navigate to Stat Tracker V3
3. Start a new game or continue existing game
4. **Open browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
5. Look for `🕐 ClockEngine:` logs

## Test 1: Steal - Clock Continues ✅

### Steps:
1. **Start game clock** (click "Start" button)
2. Verify clock is counting down (e.g., 12:00 → 11:59 → 11:58...)
3. Select any player
4. Click **"STL"** (Steal) button
5. **IMMEDIATELY observe**:
   - ⏰ **Game clock should CONTINUE running** (not pause)
   - 🕐 Shot clock resets to 24s
   - 🔄 Possession flips to stealing team
   - 📝 Last action displays "STEAL"

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🕐 ClockEngine: Steal detected - clock CONTINUES (live ball)
🕐 Clock automation: ['Shot clock reset to 24s']
🏀 PHASE 3 DEBUG: Processing possession event
✅ Possession updated: [stealing team]
```

### ❌ FAIL If:
- Clock pauses after steal
- Console shows "Pausing clocks for steal"
- Clock stops counting down

### ✅ PASS If:
- Clock continues running smoothly
- Shot clock resets to 24s
- Possession flips correctly
- Console shows "clock CONTINUES"

---

## Test 2: Turnover (Dead Ball) - Clock Pauses ✅

### Steps:
1. **Start game clock** (running)
2. Select any player
3. Click **"TOV"** (Turnover) button
4. Select turnover type: **"Traveling"** or **"Double Dribble"** (dead ball violation)
5. **IMMEDIATELY observe**:
   - ⏰ **Game clock should PAUSE** (stop counting)
   - 🕐 Shot clock resets to 24s
   - 🔄 Possession flips to opponent
   - 📝 Last action displays "TURNOVER"

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🕐 ClockEngine: Dead ball turnover (traveling) - clock PAUSES
🕐 Clock automation: ['Auto-paused clocks (turnover)', 'Shot clock reset to 24s']
```

### ✅ PASS If:
- Clock stops immediately
- Shot clock resets to 24s
- Possession flips correctly
- Console shows "clock PAUSES"

---

## Test 3: Foul - Immediate Pause ✅

### Steps:
1. **Start game clock** (running)
2. Note the current time (e.g., 11:45)
3. Select any player
4. Click **"FOUL"** button
5. **IMMEDIATELY observe** (BEFORE modal appears):
   - ⏰ **Game clock should PAUSE immediately**
   - Clock should stop at the exact time when button was clicked
6. Foul type modal appears
7. Select any foul type
8. **Verify clock is still paused** throughout the entire sequence

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🕐 FOUL: Pausing clock immediately (before modals)
🕐 ClockEngine: Pausing clocks for foul
```

### ❌ FAIL If:
- Clock continues running after clicking "FOUL"
- Clock pauses only after selecting foul type
- Clock pauses only after FT modal

### ✅ PASS If:
- Clock pauses **instantly** when "FOUL" button is clicked
- Clock remains paused during foul type selection
- Clock remains paused during victim selection
- Clock remains paused during FT sequence
- Console shows "Pausing clock immediately (before modals)"

## Test 4: Made Shot - Clock Continues ✅

### Steps:
1. **Start game clock** (running)
2. Select any player
3. Click **"FG"** → **"Made"**
4. **IMMEDIATELY observe**:
   - ⏰ **Game clock should CONTINUE running**
   - 🕐 Shot clock resets to 24s
   - 🔄 Possession flips to opponent
   - 📝 Last action displays "FIELD GOAL (made)"

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🕐 ClockEngine: Event made_shot - clock CONTINUES
🕐 Clock automation: ['Shot clock reset to 24s']
```

### ✅ PASS If:
- Clock continues running
- Shot clock resets to 24s
- Possession flips correctly

## Test 5: Comprehensive Flow Test ✅

### Scenario: Full Game Sequence
1. **Start clock** (12:00)
2. **Made shot** → Clock continues ✅
3. **Steal** → Clock continues ✅
4. **Turnover (traveling)** → Clock pauses ✅
5. **Restart clock**
6. **Foul** → Clock pauses immediately ✅
7. Complete FT sequence
8. **Restart clock**
9. **Made shot** → Clock continues ✅

### ✅ PASS If:
- All events behave according to NBA rules
- Clock automation is smooth and natural
- No unexpected pauses or continues
- Console logs are clear and accurate

## 🔍 Debug Console Logs

### What to Look For:

**Good Logs** (Expected):
```
🕐 ClockEngine: Steal detected - clock CONTINUES (live ball)
🕐 ClockEngine: Dead ball turnover (traveling) - clock PAUSES
🕐 FOUL: Pausing clock immediately (before modals)
🕐 ClockEngine: Pausing clocks for foul
🕐 ClockEngine: Event made_shot - clock CONTINUES
```

**Bad Logs** (Bugs):
```
❌ 🕐 ClockEngine: Pausing clocks for steal  // WRONG - should continue
❌ 🕐 ClockEngine: Live ball turnover (traveling) - clock CONTINUES  // WRONG - should pause
❌ (No "Pausing clock immediately" log when foul clicked)  // WRONG - should pause before modal
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Turnover Modifier Not Set
**Scenario**: User records turnover without selecting a specific type  
**Expected**: Clock should pause (default to dead ball)  
**Actual**: Clock pauses ✅  
**Console**: `🕐 ClockEngine: Dead ball turnover (unspecified) - clock PAUSES`

### Edge Case 2: Clock Already Paused
**Scenario**: User clicks foul when clock is already paused  
**Expected**: No change, clock remains paused  
**Actual**: Clock remains paused ✅  
**Console**: No "Pausing clock immediately" log (clock already paused)

### Edge Case 3: Steal Auto-Turnover
**Scenario**: Steal generates auto-turnover for opponent  
**Expected**: Both events recorded, clock continues  
**Actual**: Clock continues ✅  
**Note**: The auto-generated turnover does NOT trigger clock pause (correct behavior)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### All Tests Must Pass:
- ✅ Steals keep clock running (live ball)
- ✅ Dead ball turnovers pause clock
- ✅ Fouls pause clock immediately (before modals)
- ✅ Made shots keep clock running
