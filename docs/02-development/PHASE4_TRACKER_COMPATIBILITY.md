# üéØ Phase 4: Tracker Compatibility Analysis

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Purpose**: Analyze Phase 4 readiness for Stat Admin vs Coach Tracker  
**Status**: PARTIALLY READY - Needs Coach Mode Refinements

---

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ **Stat Admin Tracker (Regular Games)**
**Status**: FULLY READY

Phase 4 works perfectly for stat admin because:
- Both teams have full rosters with real players
- Assists: Can select from teammate list
- Rebounds: Can select from either team
- Blocks: Can select from defensive players
- Steals ‚Üí Turnovers: Auto-generates for opponent team player

**Example Flow:**
1. Team A player makes shot
2. AssistPromptModal shows Team A players (excluding shooter)
3. User selects assister
4. Both events linked in database ‚úÖ

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Coach Tracker (Coach Games)**
**Status**: NEEDS REFINEMENTS

Phase 4 has issues with coach mode because:
- **Home Team**: Has real players (customized + regular) ‚úÖ
- **Opponent**: Generic team with NO individual players ‚ùå

**Current Issues:**

#### **Issue 1: Steal ‚Üí Turnover (FIXED)**
- ‚ùå **Before**: Tried to use `'opponent-team'` string as UUID
- ‚úÖ **After**: Uses `teamAId` with `isOpponentStat: true` flag

#### **Issue 2: Assist Prompt**
- ‚ùå **Problem**: If opponent makes shot, modal tries to show opponent players (don't exist)
- ‚úÖ **Solution Needed**: Disable assist prompt for opponent shots in coach mode

#### **Issue 3: Rebound Prompt**
- ‚ùå **Problem**: Modal shows two columns (Team A | Team B), but Team B is just "Opponent"
- ‚úÖ **Solution Needed**: 
  - If home team missed: Show home team players + "Opponent" button
  - If opponent missed: Show home team players only (defensive rebound)

#### **Issue 4: Block Prompt**
- ‚ùå **Problem**: If opponent misses, modal tries to show opponent players as blockers
- ‚úÖ **Solution Needed**: 
  - If home team missed: Show opponent as single "Opponent" button
  - If opponent missed: Show home team players (they blocked)

---

## üîß REQUIRED REFINEMENTS

### **1. Disable Prompts for Opponent Actions**

```typescript
// In useTracker.ts - PlayEngine integration

// Only show prompts if NOT opponent stat in coach mode
if (playResult.shouldPrompt && playResult.promptType) {
  // ‚úÖ COACH MODE FIX: Don't prompt for opponent actions
  if (isCoachMode && stat.isOpponentStat) {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping prompt for opponent action in coach mode');
    return; // Don't show modal
  }
  
  // Show modal for home team actions
  setPlayPrompt({
    isOpen: true,
    type: playResult.promptType,
    sequenceId: playResult.sequenceId || null,
    primaryEventId: null,
    metadata: playResult.metadata || null
  });
}
```

### **2. Update Rebound Modal for Coach Mode**

```typescript
// In ReboundPromptModal.tsx

interface ReboundPromptModalProps {
  // ... existing props ...
  isCoachMode?: boolean;
  opponentName?: string;
}

// Inside modal:
{isCoachMode ? (
  // Coach Mode: Show home team + "Opponent" button
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <h3>Home Team</h3>
    {teamAPlayers.map(player => (
      <PlayerButton key={player.id} player={player} />
    ))}
    
    <h3>Opponent</h3>
    <button onClick={() => onSelectPlayer('opponent-team', 'defensive')}>
      <Users /> {opponentName}
    </button>
  </div>
) : (
  // Regular Mode: Two columns
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <div>{/* Team A */}</div>
    <div>{/* Team B */}</div>
  </div>
)}
```

### **3. Update Block Modal for Coach Mode**

```typescript
// In BlockPromptModal.tsx

// If shooter was opponent, show "Opponent" button
// If shooter was home team, show home team players

{isCoachMode && shooterIsOpponent ? (
  <button onClick={() => onSelectPlayer('opponent-team')}>
    <Shield /> Opponent Team
  </button>
) : (
  defensivePlayers.map(player => (
    <PlayerButton key={player.id} player={player} />
  ))
)}
```

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Phase 4.1: Coach Mode Compatibility** (NEXT)

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Fix steal ‚Üí turnover UUID error (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Disable prompts for opponent actions in coach mode
3. ‚è≥ Add "Opponent" button option to ReboundPromptModal
4. ‚è≥ Add "Opponent" button option to BlockPromptModal
5. ‚è≥ Update AssistPromptModal to skip opponent shots
6. ‚è≥ Test all scenarios in coach mode
7. ‚è≥ Update documentation

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/hooks/useTracker.ts` (prompt logic)
- `src/components/tracker-v3/modals/ReboundPromptModal.tsx`
- `src/components/tracker-v3/modals/BlockPromptModal.tsx`
- `src/components/tracker-v3/modals/AssistPromptModal.tsx`

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Stat Admin Tracker (Regular Games)**
- [x] Assist prompt after made shot
- [x] Rebound prompt after missed shot
- [x] Block prompt after missed shot
- [x] Steal auto-generates turnover
- [x] All events linked in database

### **Coach Tracker (Coach Games)**
- [x] Steal by home team ‚Üí Turnover to opponent (generic)
- [ ] Steal by opponent ‚Üí Turnover to home team player
- [ ] Made shot by home team ‚Üí Assist prompt (home players only)
- [ ] Made shot by opponent ‚Üí NO prompt (skip)
- [ ] Missed shot by home team ‚Üí Rebound prompt (home + opponent button)
- [ ] Missed shot by opponent ‚Üí Rebound prompt (home players only)
- [ ] Missed shot by home team ‚Üí Block prompt (opponent button)
- [ ] Missed shot by opponent ‚Üí Block prompt (home players only)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### **Option 1: Deploy Now (Stat Admin Only)**
- Phase 4 works perfectly for stat admin
- Disable Phase 4 for coach mode temporarily
- Deploy and test with organizers
- Fix coach mode in Phase 4.1

### **Option 2: Wait for Coach Mode Fix**
- Complete Phase 4.1 refinements first
- Test both trackers thoroughly
- Deploy everything together
- More complete but delayed

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Deploy for stat admin now, fix coach mode next.

---

## üìù NOTES

### **Why Coach Mode is Different**
- Stat Admin: Full rosters for both teams (UUID-based)
- Coach: Home team has players, Opponent is generic (no UUIDs)
- Database uses `is_opponent_stat` flag for opponent actions
- UI needs to handle "Opponent" as a single entity, not individual players

### **Design Decision**
When opponent performs action in coach mode:
- **Scoring**: Opponent button (already working)
- **Assists**: Skip prompt (opponent has no teammates)
- **Rebounds**: Show "Opponent" button option
- **Blocks**: Show "Opponent" button option
- **Steals**: Auto-generate turnover (no prompt)

This keeps the UX simple and consistent with the existing coach tracker design.
