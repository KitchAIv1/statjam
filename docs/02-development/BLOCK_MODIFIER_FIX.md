# Block Modifier Fix

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Block stats failing with database constraint violation

---

## 🐛 Issue

When recording a block stat in the sequential prompt flow (missed shot → block prompt → rebound prompt), the block was failing with:

```
❌ HTTP 400: {"code":"23514","message":"new row for relation \"game_stats\" violates check constraint \"game_stats_modifier_check\""}
```

### Root Cause

The `BlockPromptModal` was recording blocks with `modifier: 'made'`, but the Phase 5 database constraint requires:

```sql
(stat_type IN ('assist', 'steal', 'block', 'turnover') AND modifier IS NULL)
```

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### File: `src/app/stat-tracker-v3/page.tsx` (Line 1042)

**Before:**
```typescript
await tracker.recordStat({
  gameId: gameIdParam,
  playerId: playerId,
  teamId: teamAPlayers.find(p => p.id === playerId)?.id ? gameData.team_a_id : gameData.team_b_id,
  statType: 'block',
  modifier: 'made'  // ❌ INVALID
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
await tracker.recordStat({
  gameId: gameIdParam,
  playerId: playerId,
  teamId: teamAPlayers.find(p => p.id === playerId)?.id ? gameData.team_a_id : gameData.team_b_id,
  statType: 'block'
  // No modifier - database constraint requires NULL
});
```

## ✅ Verification

### Test Case: Block → Rebound Sequence
1. ✅ Record missed shot
2. ✅ Block prompt appears
3. ✅ Select blocking player
4. ✅ Block recorded successfully (no 400 error)
5. ✅ Rebound prompt appears next
6. ✅ Both events linked via `sequence_id`

## 📊 Related Fixes

This is part of the broader Phase 5 modifier fix that also addressed:
- Assists (fixed in `PHASE5_ASSIST_MODIFIER_FIX.md`)
- Steals (fixed in `DesktopStatGridV3.tsx` and `MobileStatGridV3.tsx`)
- Turnovers (fixed in `DesktopStatGridV3.tsx` and `MobileStatGridV3.tsx`)

All these stat types require `modifier IS NULL` per the database constraint.

## 🎯 Last Action Display Assessment

### Current Implementation

The "Last Action" UI displays a simple string that is set during stat recording:
- Location: `DesktopStatGridV3.tsx` (lines 215-248) and `MobileStatGridV3.tsx` (lines 298-318)
- Data: `lastAction` (string) and `lastActionPlayerId` (string | null)
- Display: Shows player name/jersey + action text

### Sequenced Plays Handling

**Current Behavior:**
- Each stat in a sequence updates the last action independently
- Block: "Player Name - Block"
- Rebound: "Player Name - Defensive Rebound"

**Limitation:**
- Does not show the full sequence (e.g., "Block by Player A → Rebound by Player B")
- Only shows the most recent action

### Recommendation for Future Enhancement

To better display sequenced plays, consider:

1. **Option A: Sequence History** (Simple)
   - Show last 2-3 actions in a mini-feed
   - Example: "Block (Player A) → Def Reb (Player B)"

2. **Option B: Linked Action Display** (Advanced)
   - Detect when actions are linked via `sequence_id`
   - Display as a single compound action
   - Example: "Missed Shot → Block (Player A) → Def Reb (Player B)"

3. **Option C: Play-by-Play Integration** (Comprehensive)
   - Leverage existing play-by-play feed
   - Show last 3-5 events from feed in tracker
   - Already has full context and sequencing

**Current Status**: The existing implementation is **functional** for MVP. The last action display shows the most recent stat, which is sufficient for basic tracking. Enhancements can be added post-MVP based on user feedback.
