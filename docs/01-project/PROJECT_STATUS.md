## 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.5 (Turbopack), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time, Storage)
- **State Management**: React Context API (AuthContext)
- **Data Fetching**: Raw HTTP + Supabase Client (Hybrid approach)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions via `gameSubscriptionManager`

### Data Flow

**Stat Tracking** (V3 Engine):
```
1. Stat Tracker UI → useTracker hook
2. tracker.recordStat() → GameServiceV3
3. Raw HTTP POST → game_stats table
4. Real-time subscription → Live Viewer
5. Automatic UI update (silent, no loading state)
```

**Substitutions**:
```
1. Substitution Modal → handleSubConfirm
2. tracker.substitute() → INSERT game_substitutions
3. TeamServiceV3.getTeamPlayersWithSubstitutions()
4. UI updates with new roster state
5. Substitution appears in play-by-play feed
```

**Live Viewer**:
```
1. gameSubscriptionManager subscribes to game updates
2. Fetches game_stats + game_substitutions
3. Transforms to PlayByPlayEntry[] with running scores
4. React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders
5. Silent updates (no white screen flashes)
```

**Player Dashboard**:
```
1. usePlayerDashboardData fetches via PlayerDashboardService
2. Queries: identity, season averages, career highs, upcoming games
3. Upcoming games: team_players JOIN games
4. Game log: game_stats aggregated per game
5. All data cached with user ID keys
```

### Authentication Flow
```
1. AuthProvider wraps app (layout.tsx)
2. useAuthV2 manages JWT with auto-refresh
3. All child components use useAuthContext()
4. No redundant auth calls (97% reduction)
5. Token refreshes every 45 minutes automatically
```

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

### What's Working ✅
- **All core features**: Tracking, viewing, dashboards, authentication
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket subscriptions working
- **Substitutions**: Auto-UI updates + play-by-play integration
- **Responsive design**: Mobile, tablet, desktop optimized
- **Performance**: Optimized API calls, memoization, auto-refresh
- **Data integrity**: V3 engine as single source of truth

### Technical Debt 📝
- Aggregated tables (`player_season_averages`, `player_career_highs`) are empty - backend needs to implement aggregation pipeline
- Some UI polish needed (charts, advanced analytics)
- NBA card generation feature placeholder (coming soon)

### Known Limitations
- Player Dashboard relies on `game_stats` (V3) - historical `stats` table data not integrated
- Upcoming games only show for players assigned to teams in `team_players`
- No mobile app (web-only for now)
