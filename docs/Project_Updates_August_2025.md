## 🚀 Recent Major Fixes

### 1. Scoring System Overhaul (August 5, 2025)
**Issue:** Scoring was not updating in real-time, required page refresh  
**Solution:** Simplified architecture to use single data source

#### Changes Made:
- **Removed:** Complex local score state management
- **Removed:** `GameStateSync` component dependency
- **Removed:** `updateScoresFromStat()` function
- **Added:** Real-time score calculation from `game_stats` table
- **Result:** Scores now update immediately with stat clicks

#### Files Modified:
```
src/app/stat-tracker/page.tsx
src/hooks/useGameStream.tsx
src/app/game-viewer/[gameId]/components/PlayEntry.tsx
src/lib/types/playByPlay.ts
```

### 2. Database RLS Policy Fixes (August 5, 2025)
**Issue:** 403 Forbidden errors on stat recording  
**Solution:** Comprehensive RLS policy updates

#### Backend Fixes Applied:
- ✅ `game_stats_full_policy` - Allows authenticated inserts
- ✅ `stats_authenticated_policy` - Enables trigger updates
- ✅ `update_stats_trigger` - Active and functional
- ✅ `game_stats_stat_type_check` - Updated constraint values

### 3. Play-by-Play Viewer Implementation (August 5, 2025)
**Issue:** No real-time game viewing capability  
**Solution:** NBA-style play-by-play viewer

#### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Real-time subscription to `game_stats`
- ✅ Live score updates
- ✅ Chronological play feed
- ✅ Team name resolution
- ✅ Public access (no authentication required)

## 🏀 Scoring System Overhaul

### Before (Complex Architecture)
```
Stat Click → Local Score State → GameStateSync → games UPDATE → Subscription → Viewer
```

### After (Simplified Architecture)
```
Stat Click → game_stats INSERT → Same Subscription → Viewer Calculates Scores
```

### Benefits:
- **Real-time Updates:** No refresh needed
- **Consistent Data:** Scores always match play-by-play
- **Simplified Code:** Reduced complexity by 82 lines
- **Better Performance:** Single data source, fewer API calls

### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Score calculation from game_stats
const calculateScoresFromStats = (stats: any[], teamAId: string, teamBId: string) => {
  let homeScore = 0;
  let awayScore = 0;
  
  stats.forEach(stat => {
    if (stat.modifier === 'made') {
      let points = 0;
      if (stat.stat_type === 'three_pointer') points = 3;
      else if (stat.stat_type === 'field_goal') points = 2;
      else if (stat.stat_type === 'free_throw') points = 1;
      
      if (stat.team_id === teamAId) homeScore += points;
      else if (stat.team_id === teamBId) awayScore += points;
    }
  });
  
  return { homeScore, awayScore };
};
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript

- **Styling:** Inline styles (performance-focused)
- **Real-time:** Supabase subscriptions

### Backend Stack
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (images)

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Tournaments
tournaments (id, name, organizer_id, start_date, end_date, status)

-- Teams
teams (id, name, tournament_id, coach_id)

-- Games
games (id, tournament_id, team_a_id, team_b_id, stat_admin_id, status, quarter, scores)

-- Game Statistics
game_stats (id, game_id, player_id, team_id, stat_type, modifier, quarter, timestamp)

-- Player Statistics (aggregated)
stats (match_id, player_id, points_made, assists, rebounds, etc.)

-- Users
users (id, email, role, premium_status)
```

### Key Relationships
- **Tournaments** → **Teams** (one-to-many)
- **Games** → **Teams** (many-to-two)
- **Game Stats** → **Games** (many-to-one)
- **Stats** → **Game Stats** (aggregated via triggers)
