## üéØ Key Features Implementation

### Mixed Roster Support

**Database Design**:
- `team_players` table supports both `player_id` and `custom_player_id`
- Constraint ensures exactly one is set: `CHECK (player_id IS NOT NULL OR custom_player_id IS NOT NULL)`
- RLS policies handle both types of players

**Service Layer**:
- `CoachPlayerService.getCoachTeamPlayers()` fetches both types
- Graceful fallback if custom players migration not applied
- Migration checker utility provides status information

**UI Components**:
- `CoachPlayerSelectionList` toggles between search and create modes
- `CreateCustomPlayerForm` handles custom player creation
- `CoachPlayerManagementModal` displays both types with appropriate badges

### Player Validation

**Minimum Player Requirement**:
- Quick Track requires minimum 5 players
- `CoachPlayerService.validateMinimumPlayers()` checks count
- UI shows validation messages and blocks progression
- Real-time player count updates in team cards

**Validation Points**:
- Team creation (Step 2): Warn if no players added
- Quick Track launch: Block if < 5 players
- Player removal: Warn if would drop below minimum

### Migration Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- `MigrationChecker.hasCustomPlayersMigration()` checks schema
- Services handle missing tables/columns gracefully
- UI shows appropriate warnings and disables features
- Error messages guide users to apply migrations

**Migration Status**:
- Check for `custom_players` table existence
- Check for `custom_player_id` column in `team_players`
- Provide specific error messages for missing components

**Coach Data Access**:
- Coaches can only access their own teams, players, and games
