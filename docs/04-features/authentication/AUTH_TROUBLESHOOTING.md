# 🔧 AUTH REDIRECT LOOP FIX

**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Infinite redirect loop causing flickering and multiple profile fetches  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 **THE PROBLEM**

### **Symptoms:**
- Page flickering continuously
- Auth page reloading every ~100ms
- Console showing hundreds of log messages:
  ```
  🔐 useAuthV2: Session found, loading profile...
  ✅ useAuthV2: User loaded: stat@example.com
  🔐 AuthPageV2 (V2): User is logged in, redirecting...
  (REPEAT INFINITELY)
  ```
- Server logs showing `/auth` and `/dashboard/stat-admin` requests every few milliseconds
- User unable to actually navigate to dashboard

### **Root Cause:**
React's `router.push()` doesn't immediately unmount the component. The `useEffect` with `[user, loading, router]` dependencies kept re-running because:

1. Component renders with user data
2. `useEffect` triggers redirect
3. Route starts changing but component still mounted
4. React re-renders (hot reload or state change)
5. `useEffect` runs AGAIN
6. **INFINITE LOOP**

---

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION**

### **Fix #1: Prevent Multiple Redirects**
Added `React.useRef` to track if redirect already happened:

```typescript
// ✅ FIX: Use ref to prevent redirect loop
const hasRedirected = React.useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !loading && !hasRedirected.current) {
    hasRedirected.current = true; // ✅ Only redirect once
    console.log('🔐 Redirecting...');
    router.push('/dashboard/stat-admin');
  }
}, [user, loading, router]);
```

**Why this works:**
- `useRef` persists across re-renders but doesn't trigger re-renders
- Once `hasRedirected.current = true`, redirect won't run again
- Component can safely re-render without triggering another redirect

---

### **Fix #2: Early Return While Redirecting**
Show a clean "Signed In" screen instead of the auth form:

```typescript
// ✅ FIX: Show loading while redirecting
if (user && !loading) {
  return (
    <div>✅ Signed In! Redirecting to your dashboard...</div>
  );
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Prevents rendering the auth form while redirecting
- Gives user feedback that sign-in was successful
- Stops form from triggering any additional effects

---

### **Fix #3: Cleanup in useAuthV2**
Added `isMounted` check to prevent state updates after unmount:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  
  const loadUser = async () => {
    // ... fetch user profile ...
    if (isMounted) {
      setState({ user: profile, loading: false, error: null });
    }
  };
  
  loadUser();
  
  return () => {
    isMounted = false; // ✅ Cleanup
  };
}, []); // ✅ Empty deps = run ONCE
```

**Why this works:**
- Prevents "Can't perform React state update on unmounted component" warnings
- Ensures effect only runs once on mount
- Cleans up properly when component unmounts

## 🎯 **RESULTS**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Page flickering constantly
- ❌ Hundreds of API calls per second
- ❌ Infinite redirect loop
- ❌ Server logs flooded
- ❌ User can't navigate

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Clean, single redirect
- ✅ One API call to load profile
- ✅ Smooth "Signed In" message
- ✅ Instant navigation to dashboard
- ✅ Zero flickering

---

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Test Case 1: Sign In**
1. Go to `/auth`
2. Enter credentials and click "Sign In"
3. Should see "✅ Signed In! Redirecting..." for ~200ms
4. Should redirect to dashboard
5. Console should show:
   ```
   🔐 useAuthV2: Session found, loading profile...
   ✅ useAuthV2: User loaded: user@example.com role: stat_admin
   🔐 AuthPageV2 (V2): User is logged in, redirecting based on role: stat_admin
   ```
   **ONCE ONLY** (no repeats)

### **Test Case 2: Already Signed In**
1. User already signed in with session in localStorage
2. Navigate to `/auth`
3. Should immediately show "✅ Signed In!" screen
4. Should redirect to dashboard
5. No flickering

### **Test Case 3: Page Refresh**
1. Sign in successfully
2. Get redirected to dashboard
3. Refresh page
4. Should stay on dashboard (not redirect back to auth)

---

## 📝 **FILES MODIFIED**

1. **`src/components/auth/AuthPageV2.tsx`**
   - Added `hasRedirected` ref
   - Added early return with "Signed In" screen

2. **`src/hooks/useAuthV2.ts`**
   - Added `isMounted` cleanup
   - Ensured `useEffect` runs only once

---

## 🔍 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **React Router Behavior:**
- `router.push()` is **asynchronous**
- Component stays mounted during route transition
- `useEffect` can run multiple times during transition
- **Always use refs to track one-time actions in effects**

### **React Strict Mode:**
- In development, React runs effects twice
- Must handle cleanup properly
- Use `isMounted` pattern for async operations

### **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: No protection from multiple redirects
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    router.push('/dashboard'); // Runs on every render!
  }
}, [user, router]);

// ✅ GOOD: Protected with ref
const hasRedirected = useRef(false);
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !hasRedirected.current) {
    hasRedirected.current = true;
    router.push('/dashboard'); // Runs once
  }
}, [user, router]);
```

## ✅ **COMPLETION STATUS**

**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Testing**: Manual testing passed  
**Performance**: Zero flickering, instant redirects  
**User Experience**: Professional, smooth authentication flow

---

## 🎯 **TAKEAWAY**

**When using `router.push()` in a `useEffect`, ALWAYS:**
1. Use a `ref` to track if redirect already happened
2. Add an early return to prevent re-rendering during transition
3. Add cleanup in async effects to prevent state updates after unmount

This prevents infinite loops and ensures a smooth user experience.
