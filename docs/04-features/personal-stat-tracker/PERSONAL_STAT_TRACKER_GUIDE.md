## üîí **Security & Privacy**

### **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- Players can only access their own personal games
- No cross-player data visibility
- Service role access for admin/analytics

### **Data Validation**
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- Shooting ratio constraints (made ‚â§ attempted)
- Reasonable stat limits (points ‚â§ 200, etc.)

### **Rate Limiting**
- Maximum 10 personal games per day per player
- Database-level enforcement
- Prevents spam/abuse

---

## üìä **Statistics & Calculations**

### **Basic Calculations**
```typescript
// Field Goal Percentage
fg_percentage = (fg_made / fg_attempted) * 100

// Effective Field Goal Percentage
efg_percentage = ((fg_made + 0.5 * three_pt_made) / fg_attempted) * 100

// True Shooting Percentage
ts_percentage = points / (2 * (fg_attempted + 0.44 * ft_attempted)) * 100
```

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Great Game**: 30+ points OR (20+ points AND 8+ assists)
- **Good Game**: 20+ points OR (15+ points AND 8+ rebounds/6+ assists)
- **Career Highs**: Tracked per stat category
- **Shooting Averages**: Calculated across all games
