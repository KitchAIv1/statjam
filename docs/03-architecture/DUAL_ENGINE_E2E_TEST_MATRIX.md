## üéØ PLAYWRIGHT CONVERSION TEMPLATE

```typescript
// Example: E2E-CLK-001 converted to Playwright
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Clock Automation', () => {
  test('E2E-CLK-001: Auto-Pause on Personal Foul', async ({ page }) => {
    // Preconditions
    await page.goto('/stat-tracker-v3?gameId=test-game');
    await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="game-clock"]');
    
    // Verify initial state
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="game-clock"]')).toHaveText('12:00');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="game-clock-running"]')).toHaveAttribute('data-running', 'true');
    
    // Steps
    await page.click('[data-testid="foul-button"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="player-home-5"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="foul-type-personal"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="confirm-button"]');
    
    // Expected state
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="game-clock-running"]')).toHaveAttribute('data-running', 'false');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="shot-clock-running"]')).toHaveAttribute('data-running', 'false');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="game-clock"]')).toHaveText('12:00');

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. **Convert to Playwright/Jest**: Use template above for all 87 tests
2. **Set up test data**: Create test tournaments with different rulesets
3. **Mock automation flags**: Test with flags ON and OFF
4. **Run in CI/CD**: Automate test execution on every PR
5. **Generate coverage report**: Ensure 100% coverage of automation features

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025  
**Total Tests**: 87  
**Status**: READY FOR CONVERSION  
**Estimated Conversion Time**: 40 hours
