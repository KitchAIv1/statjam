# CRITICAL: Backend RLS Policy Investigation Required

## Issue Summary
**Status**: CRITICAL - Backend claims fixes applied but 403 errors persist
**Date**: Tuesday, August 5, 2025, 9:03 PM PDT
**Error**: Still receiving `403 Forbidden` on INSERT to `game_stats`

## Contradiction Analysis

### Backend Team Claims:
1. ✅ RLS enabled on `game_stats`: `[{ "tablename": "game_stats", "rowsecurity": true }]`
2. ✅ Trigger active: `[{ "tgname": "update_stats_trigger" }]`
3. ✅ Policies applied: `game_stats_full_policy` and `stat_admin_game_stats_policy`

### Frontend Reality:
```
❌ xhunnsczqjwfrwgjetff.supabase.co/rest/v1/game_stats:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
```

## Required Immediate Investigation

The backend team needs to execute these diagnostic queries **RIGHT NOW**:

### 1. Verify Policies Actually Exist
```sql
-- Check if policies actually exist on game_stats table
SELECT 
    policyname, 
    tablename, 
    roles,
    cmd,
    permissive,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'game_stats'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Expected**: Should show `game_stats_full_policy` and/or `stat_admin_game_stats_policy`
**If empty**: Policies were never actually created

### 2. Test Direct Database Access
```sql
-- Test if current user can insert into game_stats
-- (Run this as the authenticated user or test user)
INSERT INTO game_stats (
    game_id, 
    player_id, 
    team_id, 
    stat_type, 
    stat_value, 
    modifier, 
    quarter, 
    game_time_minutes, 
    game_time_seconds
) VALUES (
    'c28edbdb-3e03-4cd7-b1f8-15c96b47cde5',
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001',
    'ef1257fa-fe27-48c1-a430-5085325719f0',
    'steal',
    1,
    'made',
    3,
    12,
    0
);
```

**If this fails**: RLS policy is wrong or missing
**If this succeeds**: Issue is with Supabase API or authentication

### 3. Check Authentication Context
```sql
-- Check what user context Supabase is using
SELECT 
    current_user,
    session_user,
    auth.uid() as auth_uid,
    auth.role() as auth_role;
```

### 4. Verify Policy Logic
```sql
-- If policies exist, check their actual logic
SELECT 
    policyname,
    qual as using_expression,
    with_check as with_check_expression
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'game_stats';
```

## Possible Root Causes

### A. Policies Never Actually Created
- Backend team ran verification queries but not the CREATE POLICY statements
- Policies exist in a different schema or database

### B. Incorrect Policy Logic
- Policy exists but has wrong authentication logic
- Policy checking wrong user ID or role

### C. Supabase API Issues
- Caching problem in Supabase
- Authentication token not properly passed
- API endpoint misconfigured

### D. Schema/Permission Issues
- `authenticated` role doesn't have necessary permissions
- Policies applied to wrong table or schema

## Immediate Action Required

**Backend Team: Please execute all diagnostic queries above and provide results immediately.**

**Critical Questions:**
1. Do the policies actually exist? (Query 1)
2. Can you manually insert into game_stats? (Query 2) 
3. What authentication context is being used? (Query 3)
4. What is the actual policy logic? (Query 4)

## Frontend Status
- ✅ Frontend is working perfectly
- ✅ Data formatting is correct
- ✅ Authentication is working (stat admin logged in)
- ❌ Database INSERT blocked by RLS

**This is 100% a backend configuration issue.**

## Priority: IMMEDIATE
Every minute this persists blocks all stat tracking functionality. Please provide diagnostic results within 15 minutes.
