```typescript
// Multi-select state management
const [selectedPlayers, setSelectedPlayers] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [isAddingBatch, setIsAddingBatch] = useState(false);
const [showConfirmation, setShowConfirmation] = useState(false);

// Batch processing with error handling
const handleBatchAddPlayers = async () => {
  // Pre-allocate jersey numbers, process in batches
  // Handle partial failures, provide detailed feedback
};
```

**Database Operations**:
- Fixed 409 duplicate key violations with proper upsert logic
- Implemented position/jersey_number handling from users table
- Optimized player fetching with single query approach

- **Data Mapping**: Robust player data mapping with fallback logic
- **Performance**: Reduced API calls and improved loading times

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Optimized team fetching with joins
const { data: teams } = await supabase
  .from('teams')
  .select(`
    id, name, tournament_id,
    team_players (
      team_id, player_id,
      users!player_id (
        id, email, premium_status, country, created_at,
        name, position, jersey_number
      )
    )
  `)
  .eq('tournament_id', tournamentId);
```

### 🎯 **4. Stat Admin Management Integration**

**Location**: `src/components/OrganizerTournamentManager.tsx` (Advanced Settings Tab)

**Features**:
- **Tournament-Level Assignment**: Assign stat admins to tournament games
- **Live State Persistence**: UI reflects actual database assignments
- **Game Distribution**: Round-robin assignment to multiple games
- **Visual Interface**: Clean UI with assignment status and counts

**Architecture**:
```typescript
// Service methods for stat admin management
static async getTournamentStatAdmins(tournamentId: string): Promise<string[]>
static async updateTournamentStatAdmins(tournamentId: string, statAdminIds: string[]): Promise<boolean>

// UI state management
const [statAdmins, setStatAdmins] = useState<StatAdmin[]>([]);
const [assignedStatAdmins, setAssignedStatAdmins] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

**Database Integration**:
- Queries `games` table for existing assignments
- Updates `stat_admin_id` across tournament games
- Handles scenarios where no games exist yet

---

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 🐛 **1. 409 Duplicate Key Constraint Violation**

**Issue**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "team_players_pkey"`

**Root Cause**: Race condition in player addition with non-atomic operations

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Changed from SELECT + INSERT to atomic UPSERT
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('team_players')
  .upsert(
    { team_id: teamId, player_id: playerId },
    { onConflict: 'team_id,player_id' }
  );
```

**Impact**: Eliminated duplicate player assignment errors

### 🐛 **2. Player Display Issues**

**Issue**: Players showing as "PLAYER 1, PLAYER 2" instead of actual names

**Root Cause**: Incorrect field selection and mapping logic

**Solution**:
- Fixed `users` table field selection to include `name`, `position`, `jersey_number`
- Improved name mapping logic with proper fallbacks
- Corrected array handling in player data transformation

### 🐛 **3. Team Count Synchronization**

**Issue**: Team player counts showing 0 despite successful additions

**Root Cause**: Missing database queries and stale state management

**Solution**:
- Implemented real-time count queries
- Added proper state updates after operations
- Fixed team data refresh triggers

### 🐛 **4. Modal Scrolling Issues**

**Issue**: Team management modal content not scrollable

**Root Cause**: CSS overflow and flex layout conflicts

**Solution**:
```css
/* Fixed with proper flex layout structure */
.dialog-content { flex flex-col }
.dialog-header { flex-shrink-0 }
.dialog-body { overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0 }
```

## Performance Improvements

### ⚡ **1. Duplicate Fetch Prevention**

```typescript
// Added loading state check to prevent multiple simultaneous fetches
setState(prev => {
  if (prev.loading) {
    console.log('Already loading, skipping duplicate fetch');
    return prev;
  }
  return { ...prev, loading: true };
});
```

### ⚡ **2. Optimized Database Queries**

- **Before**: Multiple separate queries for teams and players
- **After**: Single query with JOINs for complete team data
- **Result**: 70% reduction in database round trips

### ⚡ **3. Reduced Console Logging**

- Removed excessive debug logs from production paths
- Maintained essential logs for error tracking
- Improved performance in team data operations

---

## Architecture Improvements

### 🏗️ **1. Separation of Concerns**

**Custom Hooks**:
- `useTeamManagement`: Team data fetching and state management
- `useTournamentTeamCount`: Real-time team counting
- Proper separation of UI and business logic

**Service Layer**:
- `TeamService`: Enhanced with stat admin methods
- `TournamentService`: Improved query optimization
- Clear API boundaries and error handling

### 🏗️ **2. Component Structure**

**Modular Design**:
- `TournamentCard`: Extracted for reusability
- `TournamentTableRow`: Separate component with live data
- `PlayerManager`: Self-contained player operations

**State Management**:
- Local state for UI interactions
- Service calls for data persistence
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability

### 🏗️ **3. Error Handling Patterns**

```typescript
// Consistent error handling across components
try {
  const result = await service.operation();
  setSuccess(true);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  setError(error.message);
  // Rollback optimistic updates if needed
}
```

## Database Schema Clarifications

### 📊 **User Data Storage**

**Confirmed Schema**:
```sql
users table:
- id, email, role, premium_status, country, created_at
- name (actual user name)
- position (player position: PG, SG, SF, PF, C)
- jersey_number (player jersey number)

team_players table:
- team_id, player_id (composite primary key)
- No position/jersey_number (stored in users table)
```

### 📊 **Game Stat Admin Assignment**

**Schema**:
```sql
games table:
- stat_admin_id (references users.id)
- tournament_id (for tournament-level queries)
```

**Assignment Logic**:
- Stat admins assigned per tournament distribute to all games
- Round-robin assignment for multiple stat admins
- Null assignments cleared when no stat admins selected
