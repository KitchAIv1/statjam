# üîí StatJam RLS Complete Design & Implementation Plan

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FINAL AUTHORITATIVE VERSION  
**Purpose**: Fix RLS policies once and for all - eliminate timeouts and circular dependencies  
**Implementation**: `FINAL_RLS_CLEAN_SLATE.sql` (executes this design)

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

**Problem**: Complex RLS policies with multi-table JOINs are causing 10-15 second database timeouts.

**Root Causes**:
1. `users_organizer_select_policy` - 3-table JOIN (teams ‚Üí tournaments ‚Üí team_players)
2. `users_stat_admin_game_policy` - Complex tournaments JOIN
3. Circular dependencies between policies
4. No clear access control matrix

**Solution**: Complete RLS redesign with simple, performant policies based on clear role-based access requirements.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **Table-by-Table RLS Policy Design**

### **1. USERS Table**

**Current Problematic Policies** (TO BE REMOVED):
- ‚ùå `users_organizer_select_policy` - Complex 3-table JOIN causing timeouts
- ‚ùå `users_stat_admin_game_policy` - Complex tournaments JOIN causing timeouts

**New Simple Policies**:

```sql
-- ‚úÖ POLICY 1: Self-access (all users can see/update their own profile)
CREATE POLICY "users_self_access" ON users
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (id = auth.uid());

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 2: Organizers can see players in their teams
CREATE POLICY "users_organizer_team_players" ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    role = 'player' 
    AND id IN (
      SELECT tp.player_id 
      FROM team_players tp
      JOIN teams t ON t.id = tp.team_id
      JOIN tournaments tr ON tr.id = t.tournament_id
      WHERE tr.organizer_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 3: Stat admins can see players in their assigned games
CREATE POLICY "users_stat_admin_game_players" ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    role = 'player'
    AND id IN (
      SELECT tp.player_id
      FROM team_players tp
      WHERE tp.team_id IN (
        SELECT team_a_id FROM games WHERE stat_admin_id = auth.uid()
        UNION
        SELECT team_b_id FROM games WHERE stat_admin_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 4: Public can see player names for public games
CREATE POLICY "users_public_player_names" ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (
    role = 'player'
    AND id IN (
      SELECT tp.player_id
      FROM team_players tp
      JOIN teams t ON t.id = tp.team_id
      JOIN tournaments tr ON tr.id = t.tournament_id
      WHERE tr.is_public = true
    )
  );

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 5: New user sign-ups
CREATE POLICY "users_insert_new" ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());
```

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ No circular dependencies
- ‚úÖ Each policy has a clear, single purpose
- ‚úÖ Subqueries are simple and indexed
- ‚úÖ No multi-table JOINs in the main USING clause

CREATE POLICY "tournaments_public_view" ON tournaments
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (is_public = true);

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 3: Stat admins can view tournaments for their assigned games
CREATE POLICY "tournaments_stat_admin_view" ON tournaments
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT tournament_id 
      FROM games 
      WHERE stat_admin_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- ‚úÖ POLICY 4: Players can view tournaments for their teams
CREATE POLICY "tournaments_player_view" ON tournaments
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT t.tournament_id
      FROM teams t

## üöÄ **Migration Plan**

### **Phase 1: Backup & Audit (5 minutes)**

```sql
-- 1. Export current policies
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual as using_clause
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- 2. Save to file: current_rls_policies_backup.sql
```

### **Phase 2: Drop All Existing Policies (2 minutes)**

```sql
-- Drop all policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_self_access_policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_view_own_profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_organizer_select_policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_stat_admin_game_policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_insert_policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_self_update_policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_update_own_profile" ON users;

-- Drop all policies on other tables (tournaments, teams, games, etc.)
-- [Full list in migration SQL file]
```

### **Phase 3: Create New Policies (5 minutes)**

Apply all new policies from sections above in order:
1. Users table policies
2. Tournaments table policies
3. Teams table policies
4. Games table policies
5. Game_stats table policies
6. Team_players table policies

### **Phase 4: Test & Verify (10 minutes)**

```sql
-- Test 1: Organizer can see their tournaments
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = '<organizer_id>';
SELECT * FROM tournaments WHERE organizer_id = '<organizer_id>';

-- Test 2: Stat admin can see assigned games
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = '<stat_admin_id>';
SELECT * FROM games WHERE stat_admin_id = '<stat_admin_id>';

-- Test 3: Public can see live games
SET ROLE anon;
SELECT * FROM games WHERE status = 'live';

-- Test 4: Performance check (should be < 100ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '<user_id>';
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

1. **Performance**: All queries < 1 second (target: < 100ms)
2. **Security**: Each role can only access their authorized data
3. **No Timeouts**: GameServiceV2 and V1 work instantly
4. **No Circular Dependencies**: No policy references its own table recursively
5. **Maintainability**: Each policy has a single, clear purpose

---

## üìä **Performance Optimization**

### **Required Indexes**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_role ON users(role);

-- Tournaments table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tournaments_organizer ON tournaments(organizer_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tournaments_public ON tournaments(is_public) WHERE is_public = true;

-- Teams table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_teams_tournament ON teams(tournament_id);

-- Games table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_tournament ON games(tournament_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_stat_admin ON games(stat_admin_id) WHERE stat_admin_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_teams ON games(team_a_id, team_b_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_status ON games(status);

-- Game_stats table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_game_stats_game ON game_stats(game_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_game_stats_player ON game_stats(player_id);

-- Team_players table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_players_team ON team_players(team_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_players_player ON team_players(player_id);
```

---

## üîí **Security Validation**

### **Test Cases**

1. ‚úÖ Organizer CANNOT see other organizers' tournaments
2. ‚úÖ Stat admin CANNOT see games not assigned to them
3. ‚úÖ Player CANNOT see other players' profiles
4. ‚úÖ Public CANNOT see private tournaments
5. ‚úÖ Anon users CANNOT modify any data
6. ‚úÖ Users CAN update their own profiles
7. ‚úÖ Stat admins CAN record stats for assigned games
8. ‚úÖ Organizers CAN manage their tournaments

---

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Review this document** - Validate the access requirements match your needs
2. **Create migration SQL** - Combine all policies into executable SQL file
3. **Test in staging** - Apply to a test database first
4. **Apply to production** - Execute migration during low-traffic period
5. **Monitor performance** - Check query times and logs
6. **Update documentation** - Reflect new RLS design in all docs

---

**Status**: Ready for review and approval  
**Estimated Migration Time**: 25 minutes total  
**Risk Level**: Low (can rollback to current policies if needed)
